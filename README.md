# Sudoku Solver
Sudoku Solver is a huge project I worked on in the summer of 2018 using python. I first made my program generate sudokus. Then, I also made it solve sudokus. Then, I put that into a graphical user interface using the pygame module to make it a bit more user friendly

## Note

This project was made in 2018

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install pygame.

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

When in installed folder, type the following to run the program of your choice

```bash
python execute.py
```
